# Dynamic Flow (FastAPI Project)

This is a FastAPI-based project for testing dynamic API flow with a simple test suite.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 🔁 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aryan11072003/Dynamic_Flow.git
cd Dynamic_Flow
```

### 💻 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 📦 3. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated, install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🏃‍♂️ 4. Run the Application
The entry point of the project is dynamic_flow.py. You can start the FastAPI server by running:
```bash
python dynamic_flow.py
```


This interactive Swagger UI lets you explore and test the endpoints.

## Testing the API 🧪

The test.py file contains 3 predefined test cases that you can use to validate the API functionality. After the server is running, open a new terminal, make sure the virtual environment is activated, and run:

```bash
python test.py
```

This will execute the test cases and show the responses from the API.
